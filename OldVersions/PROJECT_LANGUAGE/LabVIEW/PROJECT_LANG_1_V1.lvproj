	<Property Name="I decided to make LabVIEW the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-LabVIEW) as LabVIEW is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the LabVIEW programming language. It only makes sense to LabVIEW the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here." Type="Str"></Property>
